The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), one of the earliest 
remote sensing analytical products used to simplify the complexities of 
multi-spectral imagery, is now the most popular index used for vegetation assessment. 
This popularity and widespread use relate
to how an NDVI can be calculated with any multispectral
sensor with a visible and a near-IR band. Increasingly low
costs and weights of multispectral sensors mean they can be
mounted on satellite, aerial, and increasingly Unmanned
Aerial Systems (UAS). While studies have found that the
NDVI is effective for expressing vegetation status and quantified 
vegetation attributes, its widespread use and
popularity, especially in UAS applications, carry inherent
risks of misuse with end users who received little to
no remote sensing education. This article summarizes the
progress of NDVI acquisition, highlights the areas of NDVI
application, and addresses the critical problems and considerations
in using NDVI. Detailed discussion mainly covers
three aspects: atmospheric effect, saturation phenomenon,
and sensor factors. The use of NDVI can be highly effective
as long as its limitations and capabilities are understood.
This consideration is particularly important to the UAS user
community. Multi-spectral remotely sensed imagery contains a combination
of bands that creates a composite image to be used for
interpretation and analysis. With multi-spectral imagery, the
individual bands in the band composite can be transformed
to get certain features and patterns to stand out better. Image
band transformations have become a common practice to
generate new images from two or more image bands for
information extraction. The new images generated this way
enhance representations to ground objects such as vegetation.
There are more than one hundred vegetation indices
that have been derived from multispectral imagery (Xue and Su 2017).
